# Speedrun and Records

Ballance's record is an important part of Ballance's environment. So far, there are many record certifiers who support the verification and display of Ballance records. In the following text, the corresponding record certifiers and their supporting record modes will be introduced one by one. Each record mode has a unique type of symbol that you can use to quickly determine what recording mode is using in some recorded videos or during everyday chat. For record publishers, it is best to mark this type of symbol on your video.
